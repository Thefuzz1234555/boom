Once upon a time, there was a bookmarklet called Quix. You could run ~100 bookmarklet based on your input; all from one single bookmarklet.

It was abandoned. I'm slowly making something to replace it. The end.

###Developing
`npm install`

The `package.json` file should install the npm module `bookmarklet`. In your shell, type `bookmarklet sboom.js` from the `src/` directory to URL encode the javascript.

Either copy/paste STDOUT and create a bookmarklet in your browser.

Or pipe it out to a file:

```shell
bookmarklet boom.js > crunched.js
```

Or copy it your clipboard (Mac):

```shell
bookmarklet boom.js | pbcopy
```

### Easy Install

Visit this page, highlight everything and drag it into your Bookmark Bar. Rename
[Boom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/audibleblink/boom/master/src/crunch.js)


__Current commands:__

Install the bookmarklet and type 'help'
