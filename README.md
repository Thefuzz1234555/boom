Once upon a time, there was a bookmarklet called Quix. You could run ~100 bookmarklet based on your input; all from one single bookmarklet.

It was abandoned. I'm slowly making something to replace it. The end.

###Usage
The `package.json` file should install the npm module `bookmarklet`. In your shell, type `bookmarklet src/boom.js` to URL encode the javascript.

Either copy/paste STDOUT and create a bookmarklet in your browser.

Or pipe it out to a file
```shell
bookmarklet boom.js > crunched.js
```


### Easy Install
Visit this page, highlight everything and drag it into your Bookmark Bar. Rename
[Boom](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/audibleblink/boom/master/src/crunch.js)


Current commands:
- plex
- pocket
- whois
